# Hello, this is Wallter

Wallter is a minimalist program that downloads a new desktop wallpaper from the website "Unsplash.com" every day.

Wallter is still young and can not do much yet. But you can teach him new tricks if you understand CSharp and have a suitable development environment.

If you have a question, comment or idea about Wallter, you can contact me via my website at https://napolitano.de.

Wallter can be used under the MIT license.
